# Achieving Perfect Focus

Learn laser focus techniques and testing procedures to ensure optimal cutting and engraving quality.

## Overview

Proper laser focus is critical for achieving clean cuts, fine details, and optimal power efficiency. This guide will help you establish and maintain perfect focus for your laser cutter.

## Prerequisites

- Calibrated machine profile
- Focus gauge or measurement tool
- Test material (cardboard or scrap material)

## Understanding Focus

The laser beam converges at a focal point where the beam diameter is smallest and power density is highest. Operating at the correct focal distance ensures:

- Maximum cutting power
- Finest engraving detail
- Consistent edge quality
- Minimal kerf width

## Focus Methods

### 1. Fixed Focus Gauge

Many laser cutters include a focus gauge or spacer:

1. **Position the gauge** between the laser head and material surface
2. **Adjust Z-height** until the gauge fits snugly
3. **Remove gauge** and verify clearance

### 2. Ramp Test

Create a focus ramp test to find the optimal focal point:

1. **Set up a test piece** at an angle to the laser head
2. **Engrave a line** across the angled surface
3. **Measure** where the line is thinnest and sharpest
4. **Record** the optimal Z-height

### 3. Focus Test Pattern

Run a focus test with multiple Z-heights:

1. **Create test squares** at different heights (Â±2mm steps)
2. **Engrave fine details** in each square
3. **Compare results** to find the sharpest output
4. **Set Z-height** to the optimal value

## Verifying Focus

After setting focus, verify with a test cut:

- Cut a small circle or square
- Check edge quality and perpendicularity
- Adjust if necessary

## Maintaining Focus

- **Check focus** before each session
- **Recalibrate** after changing the laser head or optics
- **Clean optics** regularly to maintain beam quality
- **Inspect** the focus gauge for wear or damage

## Troubleshooting

**Poor cut quality**: Recheck focus height and verify optics are clean

**Inconsistent results**: Check material flatness and bed alignment

**Weak cutting power**: Verify focal distance and inspect lens for damage
