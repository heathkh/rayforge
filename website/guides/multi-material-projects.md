# Multi-Material Projects

Learn strategies for managing projects that involve different materials, layer organization, and workflow optimization.

## Overview

Multi-material projects combine different materials in a single design, such as engraving on leather inlays in wood or combining acrylic and wood components.

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of [Multi-Layer Workflow](../features/multi-layer.md)
- Calibrated machine profile for each material
- Material test results for power/speed settings

## Planning Your Project

### 1. Design Considerations

- **Alignment**: How will materials align to each other?
- **Order of operations**: Which material should be processed first?
- **Registration marks**: Will you need alignment guides?
- **Material compatibility**: Can materials be processed together or separately?

### 2. File Organization

Use Rayforge's layer system to organize multi-material operations:

- **Assign each material** to separate layers
- **Label layers clearly** (e.g., "Wood Base", "Acrylic Top")
- **Group operations** by material type
- **Use different colors** for visual distinction

## Workflow Strategies

### Strategy 1: Sequential Processing

Process each material completely before moving to the next:

1. **Load first material** and secure in position
2. **Run all operations** for that material
3. **Mark alignment points** if needed
4. **Replace with next material**
5. **Align and secure** using registration marks
6. **Run operations** for second material

### Strategy 2: Inlay Method

For inlays and embedded elements:

1. **Cut cavity** in base material
2. **Cut inlay piece** from second material
3. **Test fit** and adjust if needed
4. **Glue and secure** inlay
5. **Final engrave or surface** if needed

### Strategy 3: Layered Assembly

For stacked or laminated designs:

1. **Cut all layers** independently
2. **Mark alignment** on each piece
3. **Test assembly** before final processing
4. **Engrave surface details** after assembly (if applicable)

## Material-Specific Settings

### Managing Different Settings

Each material requires different power/speed settings:

1. **Create operations** for each material type
2. **Assign correct settings** from material library
3. **Group operations** by material
4. **Process in logical order**

### Using Material Profiles

Save material settings for consistency:

- **Document settings** for each material combination
- **Use material test grids** to find optimal settings
- **Store profiles** for reuse in future projects

## Alignment Techniques

### Registration Marks

Add alignment markers to your design:

- **Corner marks** for positioning
- **Crosshairs** for precise alignment
- **Engraved guides** on base material

### Using the Camera

If your machine has camera alignment:

1. **Photograph base material** after first operation
2. **Import overlay image** for second material
3. **Align design** using camera preview
4. **Fine-tune position** before cutting

See [Using Camera Alignment](using-camera-alignment.md) for details.

### Jigs and Fixtures

Create reusable alignment aids:

- **Corner brackets** for consistent placement
- **Pin registration** for precise alignment
- **Templates** for repeated projects

## Common Challenges

**Misalignment**: Use registration marks and careful positioning

**Different material thicknesses**: Adjust focus for each material or use spacers

**Incompatible settings**: Process materials separately to avoid compromise

**Material damage**: Protect completed areas with masking or shields

## Example Projects

### Wood with Acrylic Inlay

1. Engrave pocket in wood base (depth operation)
2. Cut acrylic inlay piece (contour operation)
3. Test fit and adjust
4. Glue inlay into pocket
5. Engrave surface details (raster operation)

### Leather and Wood Combination

1. Cut wood components
2. Engrave leather pieces with separate settings
3. Assemble with adhesive
4. Optional: surface engrave assembled piece

## Tips for Success

- **Always test** alignment and settings on scrap first
- **Mark orientation** on materials to avoid confusion
- **Document your process** for repeatable results
- **Allow for tolerances** in fit and alignment
- **Work from rough to fine** (cut before engrave)
