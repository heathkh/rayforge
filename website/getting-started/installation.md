# Installation

Rayforge is available for Linux and Windows. Choose your platform below and follow the installation instructions.

## :fontawesome-brands-linux: Linux

Rayforge offers several installation methods for Linux users. Choose the one that best fits your distribution.

### Ubuntu & Derivatives (Recommended)

For Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and newer, as well as derivatives like Linux Mint and Pop!_OS, we recommend using our official PPA. This method provides automatic updates through your system's package manager.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:knipknap/rayforge
sudo apt update
sudo apt install rayforge
```

Once installed, launch Rayforge from your application menu or by running `rayforge` in a terminal.

### Snap Package (Cross-Distribution)

The Snap package works on most Linux distributions and includes all dependencies in a sandboxed environment.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/en/light/install.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rayforge)

Or install from the command line:

```bash
sudo snap install rayforge
```

!!! warning "Permissions Required"
    The Snap version runs in a sandbox and requires manual permission grants for hardware access.

#### Granting Permissions

**For Camera Access:**
```bash
sudo snap connect rayforge:camera
```

**For USB Serial Port Access:**
```bash
# Enable experimental hotplug support (one-time setup)
sudo snap set system experimental.hotplug=true

# Connect your laser via USB, then grant access
sudo snap connect rayforge:serial-port
```

See [Snap Permissions Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/snap-permissions.md) for more details.

### From Source (Advanced)

For developers and advanced users who want to run the latest development version or contribute to the project.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.11 or newer
