## Core Concepts

### [Understanding Operations](understanding-operations.md)

Learn what operations are and when to use each type.

**Topics covered:**
- Contour vs Raster vs Depth operations
- When to use each operation type
- How operations process geometry
- Operation execution order

**Read this if:** You're confused about which operation to choose, or want to understand how RayForge generates toolpaths.

---

### [Coordinates and Origin](coordinates-and-origin.md)

Understand how RayForge handles coordinate systems and positioning.

**Topics covered:**
- Job origin vs machine origin vs workpiece origin
- Coordinate transformations
- Absolute vs relative positioning
- Common coordinate-related mistakes

**Read this if:** Your jobs appear in the wrong position, or you don't understand how positioning works.

---

### [Power vs Speed](power-vs-speed.md)

Learn the relationship between laser power, cutting speed, and material interaction.

**Topics covered:**
- How power and speed affect cutting
- Multi-pass strategies for thick materials
- Finding optimal settings
- Reading burn marks and adjusting

**Read this if:** You're struggling to find the right settings for your material, or cuts aren't going through.

---

### [G-code Basics](gcode-basics.md)

Understand what G-code is and how RayForge generates it.

**Topics covered:**
- What is G-code and how it controls machines
- Common G-code commands explained
- How RayForge generates G-code from operations
- When and how to edit G-code manually

**Read this if:** You want to understand the output, customize G-code, or troubleshoot machine behavior.

---

### [Laser Safety](laser-safety.md)

Essential safety practices for laser cutting and engraving.

**Topics covered:**
- Eye safety and laser classes
- Material hazards (never cut PVC!)
- Fire prevention and emergency procedures
- Proper ventilation and PPE
- Emergency stop procedures

**Read this if:** You're new to laser work, or want a safety refresher. **Everyone should read this.**

## Glossary

Quick definitions of key terms:

**Operation** - A processing step that converts geometry to toolpaths (Contour, Raster, etc.)

**Toolpath** - The actual path the laser head follows

**G-code** - Machine control language that tells the controller what to do

**Origin** - The reference point (0,0) for positioning

**Power** - Laser intensity, typically 0-100%

**Speed** - How fast the laser head moves, in mm/min

**Feed rate** - Same as speed (CNC terminology)

**Workpiece** - An imported shape or image

**Layer** - A container for workpieces with a workflow

**Workflow** - The operation and transformers applied to a layer

For more terms, see the full glossary (if available) or search the documentation.
