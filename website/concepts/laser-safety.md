# Laser Safety

Laser cutting and engraving equipment poses serious safety risks including fire, toxic fumes, and permanent eye damage.

!!! danger "Critical Safety Warning"
    **Always follow your laser manufacturer's safety guidelines and operating instructions.** This page provides general safety principles but is not a substitute for proper training and your machine's specific safety documentation.

## Your Primary Safety Resource

**Read your laser manufacturer's manual completely** before operating any laser equipment. It contains:

- Specific safety requirements for your machine
- Required personal protective equipment (PPE)
- Emergency procedures
- Maintenance and inspection schedules
- Warranty and liability information

RayForge is control software - it cannot override the physical safety requirements of your laser hardware.

## Essential Safety Principles

### Never Leave Laser Unattended

**Most important rule:** Never leave a running laser unattended, even for a few seconds.

**Why:** Lasers can ignite materials instantly. A small flame can become a serious fire in seconds.

**Always:**
- Stay within arm's reach of emergency stop
- Watch the cutting process continuously
- Keep fire extinguisher accessible

### Fire Safety

**Before every job:**
- Clear workspace of flammable materials
- Remove debris from cutting bed
- Have fire extinguisher ready (ABC or CO2 type)
- Know where emergency stop button is

**If fire occurs:**
1. Press emergency stop immediately
2. Keep lid closed if fire is small (starves oxygen)
3. Use fire extinguisher if fire continues
4. Evacuate and call emergency services if fire spreads

### Ventilation is Mandatory

**All laser cutting produces toxic fumes.** Proper ventilation is not optional.

**Requirements:**
- Exhaust system venting to outside (not recirculated)
- Sufficient airflow for your machine size
- Running during all laser operations
- Regular filter replacement (if using filtration)

**Never operate without proper ventilation** - you risk serious health effects and will damage your laser's optics.

### Prohibited Materials

**Never cut or engrave these materials:**

| Material | Danger |
|----------|--------|
| **PVC / Vinyl** | Produces chlorine gas (toxic, corrosive) |
| **ABS plastic** | Produces cyanide gas (deadly) |
| **Polycarbonate** | Toxic fumes, poor results |
| **Fiberglass** | Glass particles damage lungs and optics |
| **Any material containing chlorine** | Toxic and corrosive |

**When in doubt:** Check material safety data sheet (MSDS) or test tiny sample with excellent ventilation.

### Eye Protection

Most enclosed laser systems don't require goggles during normal operation **if the enclosure is closed and has proper interlocks.**

**Eye protection required when:**
- Opening enclosure during operation
- Performing maintenance or alignment
- Machine has viewing window without laser-safe filtering
- Manufacturer specifies it

**Always check your manufacturer's requirements** - they vary by machine design and laser type.

## RayForge Safety Features

RayForge provides tools to help operate safely:

- **[Simulation Mode](../features/simulation-mode.md)** - Preview jobs before running to identify issues
- **[Material Test Grid](../features/operations/material-test-grid.md)** - Find safe settings for new materials
- **Frame Job** - Verify positioning before cutting

**These features help prevent errors but don't replace safe operating practices.**

## Pre-Operation Checklist

Before every job:

- [ ] Read and understood job requirements
- [ ] Material is safe for laser cutting
- [ ] Workspace clear of flammable materials
- [ ] Ventilation system running
- [ ] Fire extinguisher accessible
- [ ] Emergency stop location confirmed
- [ ] Material secured flat on bed
- [ ] Job previewed in Simulation Mode

## Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Stop

**When to use:**
- Fire visible
- Unusual sounds or smoke
- Material shifting dangerously
- Any emergency situation

**How:** Press red emergency stop button on machine. All motion and laser power stop immediately.

### Fire Response

**Small fire (contained):**
1. Emergency stop
2. Keep lid closed if possible
3. Use fire extinguisher if needed

**Large fire:**
1. Emergency stop
2. Evacuate immediately
3. Call emergency services
4. Do not attempt to fight large fires

### Medical Emergencies

**Eye exposure:**
- Seek immediate medical attention
- Do not rub eyes
- Bring laser specifications to doctor

**Fume inhalation:**
- Move to fresh air
- Seek medical attention if symptoms persist
- Call poison control if severe

## Training and Responsibility

**Before operating:**
- Complete any required safety training
- Read manufacturer's manual completely
- Understand emergency procedures
- Know your specific laser's hazard class and requirements

**Ongoing:**
- Review safety procedures periodically
- Maintain safety equipment
- Stay informed about new materials and hazards
- Never allow untrained users to operate equipment
