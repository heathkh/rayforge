# Features Overview

Rayforge provides a comprehensive set of features for laser cutting and engraving. This section covers all the major capabilities and how to use them effectively.

## Operations

Operations define how Rayforge processes your designs. Each operation type is optimized for specific tasks:

- **[Contour Cutting](operations/contour.md)**: Cut along the outline of shapes
- **[Raster Engraving](operations/raster.md)**: Fill shapes with engraving patterns
- **[Depth Engraving](operations/depth.md)**: Create 3D relief effects from images
- **[Shrink Wrap](operations/shrink-wrap.md)**: Create efficient cutting paths around multiple objects

## Workflow Features

- **[Multi-Layer Operations](multi-layer.md)**: Assign different operations to layers in your design for complex workflows
- **[Holding Tabs](holding-tabs.md)**: Add tabs to contour cuts to keep pieces in place during cutting
- **[G-code Macros & Hooks](macros-hooks.md)**: Automate tasks with custom G-code snippets

## Quality Enhancement

- **[Overscan & Kerf Compensation](overscan-kerf.md)**: Improve engraving quality and dimensional accuracy

## Hardware Integration

- **[Camera Integration](camera.md)**: Use a USB camera for workpiece alignment, positioning, and background tracing

## Best Practices

### Operation Selection

- Use **Contour** for cutting out shapes and profiles
- Use **Raster** for filling areas with engraving (wood, leather, etc.)
- Use **Depth Engraving** for 3D effects on materials like acrylic or coated metals
- Use **Shrink Wrap** when you need to cut around multiple objects efficiently

### Layer Organization

Organize your designs by operation type:

1. **Layer 1**: Engraving operations (run first)
2. **Layer 2**: Scoring or marking operations
3. **Layer 3**: Through-cutting operations (run last)

    A[Design File] --> B{Select Objects}
    B --> C[Layer 1: Raster/Depth<br/>Engraving]
    B --> D[Layer 2: Light Contour<br/>Scoring]
    B --> E[Layer 3: Full Power<br/>Cutting]

    C --> F[Execute in Order]
    D --> F
    E --> F

    F --> G[Material stays in place<br/>during engraving]
    G --> H[Cut free at end]

    style C fill:#e3f2fd
    style D fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#ffebee
    style H fill:#e8f5e9
```

!!! tip "Why this order?"
    Engraving first prevents the material from moving if it's cut free. Cutting last ensures all other operations complete while the material is secured.

### Power and Speed

Start with conservative settings and gradually increase:

- **Too fast/low power**: Incomplete cuts, light engraving
- **Too slow/high power**: Charring, melted edges, fire risk

Always test on scrap material first!
