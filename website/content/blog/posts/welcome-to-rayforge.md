# Welcome to Rayforge: Modern Laser Control Software

![Image title](../../{{ latest_docs }}/images/ss-main.png){align=left width="200px"}

We're excited to introduce Rayforge, a modern, open-source G-code sender and control software designed specifically for GRBL-based laser cutters and engravers.

## Why Rayforge?

In the world of laser cutting and engraving, having reliable, intuitive software is just as important as having quality hardware. Rayforge was built from the ground up with a focus on:

- **Modern User Experience**: Built with Gtk4 and Libadwaita, Rayforge offers a clean, native interface that feels at home on Linux and Windows
- **Professional Features**: Multi-layer workflows, 3D preview, camera integration, and advanced path generation
- **Flexibility**: Support for multiple machine profiles, custom macros, and extensive configuration options
- **Open Development**: Community-driven with contributions welcome

## What Makes Rayforge Different?

### Multi-Layer Operations

One of Rayforge's standout features is its multi-layer workflow. Assign different operations to different layers in your design—engrave fine details on one layer, then cut out the piece on another. All managed seamlessly in one interface.

### 3D G-code Preview

Before sending your job to the machine, visualize exactly what will happen with our 3D G-code preview. Catch potential issues before they happen and save time and materials.

### Camera Integration

Use a USB camera for precise workpiece alignment, positioning, and even background tracing. Perfect for positioning designs on pre-existing materials or creating jigs.

### Advanced Path Generation

Rayforge includes high-quality image tracing, travel time optimization, path smoothing, and spot size interpolation to ensure your projects come out exactly as planned.
