# Cutting Thick Materials

Learn multi-pass strategies and power/speed calculations for successfully cutting thick materials with your laser cutter.

## Overview

Cutting thick materials (>6mm) requires careful planning and technique. This guide covers strategies for achieving clean cuts through thick stock.

## Considerations

Thick material cutting requires:

- **Multiple passes** at appropriate power levels
- **Proper focus** maintained throughout the cut
- **Good air assist** to clear debris
- **Adequate power** for the material type
- **Patient approach** to avoid charring

## Multi-Pass Strategy

### Planning Your Passes

1. **Calculate required passes** based on material thickness and laser power
2. **Set moderate power** (60-80% of maximum)
3. **Use consistent speed** across all passes
4. **Allow cooling time** between passes if needed

### Pass Configuration

- **First pass**: Establishes the cut path
- **Middle passes**: Deepen the cut progressively
- **Final pass**: Clean through-cut

### Recommended Settings

For acrylic, wood, and similar materials:

- **3mm**: 1-2 passes at 70-80% power
- **6mm**: 2-3 passes at 80-90% power
- **10mm**: 3-5 passes at 90-100% power
- **12mm+**: 4-8 passes, consider defocusing slightly

## Focus Adjustment

Some materials benefit from focus adjustment on later passes:

- **On-focus** for initial passes (surface cutting)
- **Slightly defocused** (+1 to +2mm) for middle material
- **Refocus** for final pass if needed

## Air Assist

Strong air assist is critical for thick cuts:

- **Increase air pressure** to clear deeper cuts
- **Check nozzle positioning** throughout the cut
- **Monitor for clogging** with debris
- **Pause and clean** if necessary

## Material-Specific Tips

### Wood

- **Hardwood**: More passes at moderate power
- **Plywood**: Watch for delamination between layers
- **MDF**: Prone to charring, use higher speed

### Acrylic

- **Cast acrylic**: Cuts cleaner than extruded
- **Clear acrylic**: Watch for stress fractures
- **Colored acrylic**: May have different cutting properties

### Other Materials

Always test new materials with small samples before committing to large projects.

## Troubleshooting

**Incomplete cuts**: Add more passes or increase power slightly

**Heavy charring**: Reduce power per pass, increase speed, or improve air assist

**Tapered cuts**: Check focus and ensure perpendicular beam alignment

**Material warping**: Secure material firmly and allow cooling between passes

## Safety Notes

- **Never leave the machine unattended** during thick cuts
- **Monitor for flames** and keep fire extinguisher nearby
- **Ensure adequate ventilation** for increased smoke production
- **Check machine temperature** on long jobs
